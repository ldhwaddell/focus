# Focus

`focus.sh` is a simple Bash script to manage your system's `/etc/hosts` file. It allows you to:

- View (`list`) the contents of the hosts file.
- Add (`add`) entries to redirect specific domains to `127.0.0.1`.
- Remove (`remove`) specific entries.
- Synchronize (`sync`) by flushing the DNS cache after modifications.

This tool is designed to work on macOS and Linux systems.
